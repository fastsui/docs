VPS and Hot wallet Setup
========================

These instructions are intended for those that are setting up a MasterNode Hot wallet on a Linux VPS.  This wallet and server will run 24/7 and will provide services to the network via TCP port **10417** for which it will be rewarded with coins. It will run with an empty wallet balance, reducing the risk of losing the funds in the event of an attack.

Order and setup a Linux VPS
---------------------------
	
.. _identifyvps_vpsandhotwallet:

1. Identify a VPS provider and order a Linux Ubuntu 16.04 server.  It's important not to run the VPS at home because of the risk of network instability that could cause loss of connectivity to the server.  A VPS that meets the following requirements should cost around $5 per month.

	**Recommended VPS Providers:**
	
	* `Digital Ocean <https://m.do.co/c/95a89fb0b62d>`_
	* `Vultr <https://www.vultr.com/?ref=7318338>`_
	* `Linode <https://www.linode.com/>`_
	* `Amazon Web Services (AWS) <https://aws.amazon.com/>`_

	|br|
	**VPS Minimum Requirements:**
	
	* Linux - Ubuntu 16.04 - 64 Bit OS
	* 1GB of RAM
	* 20GB of disk space
	* Dedicated Public IP Address 
	
.. _externalfirewall_vpsandhotwallet:

2. Login to the VPS provider website and configure the external firewall to allow SSH port 22 and the Liberty Wallet TCP port 10417.
	
.. _loginviassh_vpsandhotwallet:
	
3. Login to the VPS, via SSH, as the **root** user.

	* If you need assistance using SSH then please refer to the :ref:`VPS: Getting Started with an SSH client and SSH Keys<vps_usingssh>` section of the guide for more information on how to use SSH to connect to the Linux VPS.
	* If you are running a VPS from Digital Ocean, Vultr, or a similar provider, then you need to use an SSH client, such as Putty_, if you want to have copy and paste functionality. Otherwise you will have to type all of the following commands out manually!

.. _installlinuxupdates_vpsandhotwallet:

4. Install Linux updates.  Run the following commands **one at a time**::

	apt install make
	apt install aptitude -y
	apt-get update -y
	apt-get upgrade -y

* NOTE: If a pop up window appears asking **"What would you like to do about menu.list?"** then select the option: **keep the local version currently installed**

.. _installfail2ban_vpsandhotwallet:

5. Install fail2ban and create modifiable configs for fail2ban and its jail settings.   Run these commands **one at a time** to install basic ssh protection with fail2ban::

	apt-get install fail2ban -y
	cp /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.local
	cp /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf /etc/fail2ban/jail.local

* (If you are using Ubuntu 16.04 then Fail2ban is setup to protect SSH by default, for other distributions please see `fail2ban's extensive documentation <https://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page>`_)

.. _installtzdata_vpsandhotwallet:

6. Install tzdata.  Run the following command to install the application that will allow you to select your clock timezone::

	apt install tzdata

.. _settimezone_vpsandhotwallet:

7. Set your time zone.  Run the following command to set your preferred time zone::

	dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

.. _swapspace_vpsandhotwallet:
	
8. Configure a virtual swap space on the VPS to avoid running out of memory::

	fallocate -l 3000M /mnt/3000MB.swap
	dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/3000MB.swap bs=1024 count=3072000
	mkswap /mnt/3000MB.swap
	swapon /mnt/3000MB.swap
	chmod 600 /mnt/3000MB.swap
	echo '/mnt/3000MB.swap  none  swap  sw 0  0' >> /etc/fstab
	
.. _allowssh_vpsandhotwallet:

9. Configure the VPS internal firewall to allow SSH port 22 and the Liberty Wallet port 10417::

	ufw default deny incoming
	ufw default allow outgoing
	ufw allow 22/tcp	
	ufw limit 22/tcp	
	ufw allow 10417/tcp 	
	ufw logging on
	ufw --force enable

.. _createnewuserbasic_vpsandhotwallet:
	
Create a New User and Login as xlibmn
-------------------------------------

**OPTIONAL STEP:** The following steps (1 - 3) are optional.  These steps are strongly recommended for those that want to implement security best practices.  These steps are recommended so that the Hot wallet is not installed under the root user account.

	* In these steps you will create a new user named **xlibmn**, set a password, grant that user root access, and login as the new user.
	* All advanced Liberty setup guides will assume that you used **xlibmn** as your user.
	* For those of you that want to continue to use **root** as your user instead of **xlibmn**, you can skip ahead to the next section :ref:`Download and Configure the Liberty Hot Wallet<hotwalletinstallbasic_vpsandhotwallet>`.

1. Create a new user named **xlibmn** and assign a password to the new user::

	useradd -m -s /bin/bash xlibmn
	passwd xlibmn

* Type in a new password, as you are prompted, two times.  Be sure to save this password somewhere safe, as you will need it to manage the MasterNode Hot wallet.

.. _grantrootaccessbasic_vpsandhotwallet:

2. Grant root access to the new user xlibmn::

	usermod -aG sudo xlibmn

.. _loginasnewuserbasic_vpsandhotwallet:
	
3. Login as the new user xlibmn::

	login xlibmn

.. _hotwalletinstallbasic_vpsandhotwallet:
	
Download and Configure the Liberty Hot wallet
---------------------------------------------

.. _downloadwallet_vpsandhotwallet:

1. Install the Liberty Hot wallet on the VPS.  Download and unpack the Liberty wallet binaries by running the following commands **one at a time**::

	wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/liberty-builds/5.1.1.0/linux-x64.tar.gz
	sudo tar xvzf linux-x64.tar.gz -C /usr/local/bin/
	
.. _startservice_vpsandhotwallet:
	
2. Start the Hot wallet service.  When the service starts, it will create the initial data directory **~/.liberty/**::

	libertyd -daemon
	
.. _generategenkey_vpsandhotwallet:

3. Generate the MasterNode private key (aka GenKey).  Wait a few seconds after starting the wallet service and then run this command to generate the masternode private key::

	liberty-cli createmasternodekey

.. _savegenkey_vpsandhotwallet:

4. Copy and save the MasterNode private key (GenKey) from the previous command to be used later in the process.  The value returned should look similar to the below example:

	* 87LBTcfgkepEddWNFrJcut76rFp9wQG6rgbqPhqHWGvy13A9hJK

.. _stophotwallet_vpsandhotwallet:

5. Stop the Hot wallet with the **liberty-cli stop** command::

	liberty-cli stop

.. _copyconfig_vpsandhotwallet:
	
6. Copy the liberty.conf template, paste it into a text editor, and update the variables manually.  All variables that need to be updated manually are identified with the **<>** symbols around them::
	
	rpcuser=Libertyrpc 
	rpcpassword=<alphanumeric_rpc_password> 
	rpcport=10416 
	rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 
	rpcconnect=127.0.0.1 
	rpcbind=127.0.0.1 
	maxconnections=512 
	listen=1 
	daemon=1
	masternode=1
	masternodeaddr=<public_mn_ip_address_here>
	bind=<public_mn_ip_address_here>
	masternodeprivkey=<your_masternode_genkey_output>
	
* Update the variable after **rpcpassword=** with a 40 character RPC rpcpassword.
* You will need to generate the rpcpassword yourself.
* Use the **ifconfig** command, on the Linux VPS, to find out your Linux VPS IP address.  It is normally the address listed after the **eth0** interface after the word **inet addr:** 
* Save your Linux VPS IP address as we are going to use this IP again in the Cold wallet setup
* Update the variable after **masternodeaddr=** with your Linux VPS IP
* Update the variable after **bind=** with your Linux VPS IP
* Update the variable after **masternodeprivkey=** with your MasterNode private key (GenKey)
* Once all of the fields have been updated in the text editor, copy the template into your clipboard to be used in the next steps. 

.. _editconfig_vpsandhotwallet:
	
7. Edit the MasterNode Hot wallet configuration file **~/.liberty/liberty.conf**::

	nano ~/.liberty/liberty.conf
	
.. _pastetemplate_vpsandhotwallet:

8. Paste the updated template into the **liberty.conf** configuration file on the Linux VPS.

* You can right click in Putty to paste the template into the configuration file.
* This is a real example of what the configuration file should look like when you are done updating the variables.
* The **rpcpassword**, **IP address** (`199.247.10.25` in this example), and **masternodeprivkey** will all be different for you::
	
	rpcuser=xlibuser 
	rpcpassword=someSUPERsecurePASSWORD3746375620 
	rpcport=10416 
	rpcallowip=127.0.0.1 
	rpcconnect=127.0.0.1 
	rpcbind=127.0.0.1 
	maxconnections=512 
	listen=1 
	daemon=1 
	masternode=1
	masternodeaddr=199.247.10.25
	bind=199.247.10.25
	masternodeprivkey=87LBTcfgkepEddWNFrJcut76rFp9wQG6rgbqPhqHWGvy13A9hJK 
	
.. _saveconfig_vpsandhotwallet:

9. Save and exit the file by typing **CTRL+X** and hit **Y** + **ENTER** to save your changes.

.. _starthotwallet_vpsandhotwallet:

10. Restart the Hot wallet with the **libertyd -daemon** command::

	libertyd -daemon
	
Verify the Hot wallet is synchronizing with the blockchain
----------------------------------------------------------

.. _getinfo_vpsandhotwallet:

1. Run the **liberty-cli getinfo** command to make sure that you see active connections::
	
	liberty-cli getinfo
	
.. _blockcount_vpsandhotwallet:

2. Run the **liberty-cli getblockcount** command every few mins until you see the blocks increasing::
	
	liberty-cli getblockcount

* NOTE: If your block count is **NOT** increasing then you will need to stop the Hot wallet with the **liberty-cli stop** command and then reindex with the **libertyd -reindex** command. 
* **NOTE: If you did the reindex and you continue to have issues with establishing connections then check that the VPS provider external firewall is setup correctly to allow TCP port 10417 from anywhere.  If that is not setup correctly then you will not be able to proceed beyond this step.**
	
**If your block count is indeed increasing, then you can proceed to the next step to setup the Cold wallet.**
