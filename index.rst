If you are new to cryptocurrencies, the most important change to understand is that transactions occur directly between two parties without any central authority to facilitate the transaction. This also
means that you are responsible for your own security - there is no bank or credit card company to reverse a transaction if your funds are stolen or lost. In this sense, it is similar to cash or gold, but
cryptocurrency can be spent locally and internationally with equal ease, if you are confident you are sending funds to the right destination. For these reasons, the Liberty documentation has a strong focus on safety and understanding the concepts and features that drive the Liberty ecosystem. The videos, links and documentation below can help you get started, or use the table of contents on the left to find a specific topic of interest.
